   <h1>Welcome to our MadLib</h1>
   <p>It was a 'adjective', cold November day. I woke up to the 'adjective' smell of 'type of bird' roasting in the 'room in a house' downstairs. I 'verb (past tense)' down the stairs to see if I could help 'verb' the dinner. My mom said, "See if 'relatives name' needs a fresh 'noun'." So I carried a tray of glasses full of 'a liquid' into the room. When I got there, I couldn't believe my 'part of the body (plural)'! There were 'plural noun' 'verb ending in -ing' on the 'noun'! </p>
